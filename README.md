## üì¶ Installation

Install the dependencies via any of the AUR helper (Paru example below):

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/randomboi404/eww
  cd eww
  paru -Syu --needed $(cat dependencies.lst)
```
After then, copy and paste the relevant folders to .config/

Also, create env.json in ~/.env/ and its contents must be as follows:

```bash
   {
        "WEATHER_API_KEY": "Your weather api key",
        "LOCATION": "Your city name"
   }
```
    
## ‚ùì FAQ

### The alignment looks wrong / broken.

Make sure you are using eww-git from AUR (for Arch linux) and NOT the eww package from repos.

### Everything is transparent, no colors.

Ensure Pywal is installed and applied to your wallpaper:
```bash
wal -i /path/to/wallpaper/
```
